This folder contains Jinzo custom cards.
To use these cards: Move the "pics" folder into the main YGOPro folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta)  
If there is no expansions folder, make one.
Then, move the .cdb file into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)    
Finally, move the "script" folder into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)

These cards are an expansion of the "Jinzo" support archetype.  It's somewhat
obviously based on the "Destruction Sword" archetype, but there's one very important
difference: instead of countering a specific type of monster (dragons), Jinzo
counters an entire category of cards(traps)!  The strength of this archetype is
of course its ability to punish players who rely heavily on traps, while its weakness
is that it's practically useless against something like superheavy samurais that
probably use no traps at all.
