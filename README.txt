This is a collection of custom cards made for YGOPro - Percy.

To use these cards, first download the folder(s) of any card sets you want.  
Then, open the folder on your hard drive.  
Move the "pics" folder into the main YGOPro folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta)
If there is no expansions folder, make one.  
Then, move the .cdb file into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)  
Finally, move the "script" folder into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)
If you haven't done so previously, download the "strings.conf" file and replace the one in the main folder.
You can also get the latest versions of all custom cards at once, by doing the above process with the "All Cards" folder.
