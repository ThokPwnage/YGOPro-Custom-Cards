This folder contains Tyrant custom cards.
To use these cards: Move the "pics" folder into the main YGOPro folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta)  
If there is no expansions folder, make one.
Then, move the .cdb file into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)    
Finally, move the "script" folder into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)

These cards were inspired by the late Warmetal Tyrant, whose time came far too soon.
They don't have much synergy and aren't really intended to be used in a deck together;
they're more just for novelty, although some of them could potentially be splashed
into other decks that don't necessarily require a specific archetype.
