These cards were designed after characters and their abilities from the game 
"Elsword", made by KOG Games.  Their playstyle involves upgrading the main deck 
monsters into advanced jobs, using a mechanic very similar to the "LV" monsters.
The spell cards represent abilities, and require a monster with the appropriate
job on the field to use.  As there are multiple characters, each with their own
set of abilities, there are numerous unique decks that can be created with these
cards, with varying strengths and weaknesses.  However, one common weakness is
the high dependance on Class Advance; since the level 6+ monsters can't be
summoned any other way and it can only be used once per turn, decks in this
archetype can struggle to come back from early setbacks.
