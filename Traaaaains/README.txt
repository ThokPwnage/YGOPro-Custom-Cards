Traaaaains - like trains, but zombies.  These are based on railway cards, but
with effects much more focused on graveyard manipulation.  Also, since they're
both machines and zombies at the same time, they can use support cards from
the original railway set, in addition to their own support.  Since Traaaaains
can't be banished, their most obvious weakness is Necrovalley, which largely
puts an end to their graveyard tactics.  Ironically, they also struggle against
the orignal railway cards, since they have to cycle through the graveyard before
swarming the field, which often takes too long to stop a connected liebe from
running over your lifepoints.
