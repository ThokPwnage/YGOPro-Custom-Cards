This folder contains Noble Legs custom cards.
To use these cards: Move the "pics" folder into the main YGOPro folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta)  
If there is no expansions folder, make one.
Then, move the .cdb file into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)    
Finally, move the "script" folder into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)

These cards started off as a silly pun - if noble knights have cards for their
arms, why shouldn't their legs have cards, too?  After some early brainstorming,
the potential concepts for the cards brought to mind the seven deadly sins, so
that's what I based their theme on.  In terms of gameplay, they start as equippable 
traps that attach to a noble knight.  While most of them don't directly affect
their equip target, they do activate the knights' effects, since they're treated
as noble arms cards.  Then, when sent to the graveyard as a trap(either due to
being destroyed or the equipped target leaving the field), the trap comes back as
a monster, which is treated as a noble knight and gets a new set of effects.
The general strategy generally involves stacking materials on their boss monster,
which automatically attaches any card equipped to it, and wins the duel if it
has the right combination of materials.  If you can't get the right materials in time,
another backup plan is to use the stacked-up DomiMatrix to summon a "Frozen Lady of 
Justice".  As far as weaknesses go, "Imperial Iron Wall" is a bit of a nuisance since
it prevents using "Excaliburn", while "Macro Cosmos" and "Necrovalley" shut them
down entirely, since they rely on being sent to and special summoned from the
graveyard.
