To use these cards: Move the "pics" folder into the main YGOPro folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta)  
If there is no expansions folder, make one.
Then, move the .cdb file into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)    
Finally, move the "script" folder into the expansions folder. (C:\...\ygopro_vs_links_beta\expansions)

These cards were originally inspired by "Ally of Justice" cards, although in practice
they behave more like a cross between Raidraptors and Amazoness.  Their strategy
involves searching and summoning other "Vanquisher" cards in order to summon their
synchro monsters, which have very powerful denial effects.  The main weaknesses of this
archetype are that having any "Vanquisher" card on the field prevents its owner from
special summoning any light or dark attribute monsters, and most of their oppressive
effects only work against dark attribute monsters.
