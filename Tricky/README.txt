These cards are a support archetype for "The Tricky".  It was loosely based on
"Dark Magician"'s support cards at first, but rather than powering up and protecting
the namesake monster, it presents tools to constantly move him in and out of the deck,
and tribute him to activate powerful effects.  They have a wide variety of strategies,
which can make them into the perfect companions for totally unrelated archetypes,
or a formidable deck on their own.  The main weakness of this archetype is that
they present so many options on each turn that it's deceptively easy to run out of
time before deciding on a move.
